sudo ufw allow 22
sudow ufw allow 15672
sudo ufw status ( to check status and if it is enabled)
We are only doing allows as it denies everything else by default
For webserver we are allowing port 80 and 443
80 for HTTP in dev environment and 443 for HTTPS in prod in environment
Other than that for NAGIOS we will allow port 5666

allow port 3306
